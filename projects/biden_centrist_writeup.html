									<h3 class="major">Joe's History</h3>
									<p>Much has been made about former Vice President Joe Biden’s 47-year long history of public service in America. First elected to the Senate in 1973 at the age of 29, Biden was the sixth-youngest Senator in American history. From there, Biden would go on to have a storied career: Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and the Judiciary Committee, pivotal roles in the appointments of multiple Supreme Court justices, and authorship of multiple pieces of legislation, before ultimately being elected Vice President alongside President Barack Obama.</p>

									<p>Throughout his tenure, Biden’s proven to be more of a pragmatist than an ideologue, so much so that some commentators have noted that Biden has always been in the ideological center of his party, changing as the party itself changes. All the while, parts of his Democratic party have begun a leftward march. In 2016, the ideological contest between the Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders and the more centrist Hillary Clinton highlighted the coming schism within the party, a fight that’s played out in primaries contests across the country.</p>

									<p>As he turned his sights on the Presidency in 2020, Biden ignored this interparty skirmish. He chose to not cast his election as defending the progressive left or the more moderate left, instead basing his candidacy as a battle for the ‘soul of the nation’. However, despite winning the Democratic nomination in record time, he turned around and agreed to create a joint platform with the Bernie Sanders campaign. Therefore, an observer of this situation might rightly ask: where is Biden ideologically now? And how has he changed over time?</p>
